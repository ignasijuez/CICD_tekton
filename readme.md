This project is focused on learning CI/CD practices by using the repository from Spring Projects: spring-petclinic. The goal is to deploy a pipeline across different CI/CD tools to gain hands-on experience and understand the differences between them. 

The base of the project is built with Spring Boot, which you can check out here.
